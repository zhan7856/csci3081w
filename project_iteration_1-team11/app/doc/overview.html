<h1 style="color: hotpink">Introduction</h1>
<h2>Vehicles</h2>
<p>The Visual Transit Simulator models vehicles (buses and trains) and passengers around the University of Minnesota campus.
  These vehicles provide service for a line which is made up of inbound and outbound routes. Vehicles go along a route,
  make stops, and pick up/drop off passengers.</p>
<h2>Simulation</h2>
<p>The simulation is made up of a visualization and simulation module. The visualization part shows what is happening while
  the simulation part performs the actual simulation. The configuration is stored in file called config.txt which
  defines the vehicle lines, stops, and probabilities for passengers to appear at each stop. The simulation can also be paused!</p>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<code>./gradle build</code>
<p>someone can add more details!</p>
<h2>Executing the Software</h2>
<code>./gradlew clean appRun</code>
<p>this can also use more details!</p>
<h2>Opening the Visualization Module</h2>
<p>Click the <a href="http://localhost:7777/project/web_graphics/project.html">link</a> in the terminal to open the
Visualization Module.</p>
